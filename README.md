# Image Resizing Algorithm using Seam Carving

I completed this project as one of my homework assignments for a computer science course I took at Indiana University called "Data Structures". As the course title indicates, the course centered around data structures in Java and how to implement them for practical purposes. 

In this particular project, I implemented a content-aware image resizing algorithm in Java by seam carving using energy values and dynamic programming. To test the algorithm, I created a runner class to take in a user input image, and integers for the number of vertical seams to be removed and the number of horizontal seams to be removed. Using these user inputs, the runner class resizes the given image accordingly. I also wrote JUnit tests to further test the algorithm.
